# Stackathon

## Logistics:

- Starts... Now!
- Individual project
- Presentations on Saturday 3/5/22

## The Project:

- No requirements
- Self-assigned idea
- Should be ambitious
- Must be able to be completed before presentations
- Build something cool!

## Areas of Focus

### Explore a new technology

- Libraries, tools, APIs
- Maybe capstone related?

### Build something useful/interesting for yourself

- Use your background!

#### Focus on the **wow** factor

#### The end goal is a prototype

## Presentations

- Work on your Elevator pitch, a 30 second to 1 minute description of your project
- Have an idea of how to show off your project to a viewer
- Will you be telling viewers what you have done?
- Will you be showing viewers what you have done?

## Just in case...

- Stackathon projects are ambitious
- Ambitious sometimes means they don’t get completely finished
- That’s OK! …but you must still present
- What did you work on?
- What did you discover?
- What can we learn from your efforts?
